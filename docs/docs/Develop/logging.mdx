title: Logging options in Langflow
slug: /logging
---

Langflow uses the `loguru` library for logging.

The default `log_level` is `ERROR`. Other options are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `CRITICAL`.

The default `log_file` is `langflow.log`, and its location depends on your operating system.

* Linux/WSL: `\~/.cache/langflow/`
* macOS: `/Users/\<username\>/Library/Caches/langflow/`
* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\langflow\langflow\Cache`

The `LANGFLOW_LOG_ROTATION` controls when the log file is rotated, either based on time or file size. By default, logs are rotated every 1 day.

* Time-based rotation: "1 day", "12 hours", "1 week"
* Size-based rotation: "10 MB", "1 GB"
* Disable rotation: "None" (log files will grow without limit)

The `LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV` controls log output and formatting. The `container` option outputs serialized JSON to stdout. The `container_csv` option outputs CSV-formatted plain text to stdout. The `default` (or not set) logging option outputs prettified output with [RichHandler](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/logging.html).

To modify Langflow's logging configuration, add them to your `.env` file and start Langflow.

```text
LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE=path/to/logfile.log
LANGFLOW_LOG_ROTATION='1 day'
LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV=container
```

To start Langflow with the values from your .env file, start Langflow with `uv run langflow run --env-file .env`
